    <p>
        A hungry furry baby that is always looking for trouble would be an apt description for a puppy. 
        It is important for a puppy to stay with its mother for at the very least 7 weeeks. 
        If the puppy is seperated before then it is detrimental to the dog's health and espcially in regards to their mental development.
        Before your new dog comes home you need to make sure your home is puppy-proof.
        Clean up ensuring no choking hazards are anywhere the dog can get to.
